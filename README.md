# CBU5201-Mini-Project
I built a complete deep learning pipeline in this project. It contains a supervised learning task and a unsupervised learning task. The project uses dataset "Genki4k", I conduct smile-detection and motion-estimation for supervised learning task and clustering for unsupervised learning task. Besides, I also tried Generative Adversarial Network(GAN) on this dataset.
