    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   **Basic component** [6 marks]: Using the genki4k dataset, build a machine learning pipeline that takes as an input an image and predicts 1) whether the person in the image is similing or not 2) estimate the 3D head pose labels in the image.\n",
    "2.   **Advanced component** [10 marks]: Formulate your own machine learning problem and build a machine learning solution using the genki4k dataset (https://inc.ucsd.edu/mplab/398/). \n",
    "\n",
    "Your submission will consist of two Jupyter notebooks, one for the basic component and another one for advanced component. Please **name each notebook**:\n",

    "* CBU5201_miniproject_basic.ipynb\n",
    "* CBU5201_miniproject_advanced.ipynb\n",

    "*   **Output cells**, i.e. the output from each code cell.\n",

    "How will we evaluate your submission?\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Conciseness in your writing (10%).\n",
